This repository contains designs for a text entry device that utilizes T9 text entry and column scanning to create a linear array of buttons. Column scanning was used to lessen the wire number (enabling usage of 6 rather than 9 I/O ports). The T9 text system was used so that the linear array of buttons could be bent around ones wrist, cup or other cylinders such that the keys align in three rows. Turn your wrist or cup into a text entry device with the Text Whip!
